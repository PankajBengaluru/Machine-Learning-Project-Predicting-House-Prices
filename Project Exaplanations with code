 simple machine learning project using Python and the popular scikit-learn library. In this example, we'll create a basic linear regression model to predict house prices based on the number of rooms in the house.

Step 1: Install necessary libraries
bash
Copy code
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib
Step 2: Write the code
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Generate random data for demonstration
np.random.seed(42)
X = 2 * np.random.rand(100, 1)  # Random values for the number of rooms
y = 4 + 3 * X + np.random.randn(100, 1)  # Linear relationship with noise

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model performance
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

# Plot the original data and the regression line
plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color='black', label='Actual data')
plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color='blue', linewidth=3, label='Regression line')
plt.xlabel('Number of Rooms')
plt.ylabel('House Price')
plt.title('Simple Linear Regression Example')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
Explanation:
Generate Data: We create a simple dataset with a linear relationship and some random noise.

Train-Test Split: We split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.

Create and Train Model: We create a linear regression model using LinearRegression and train it with the training data.

Make Predictions: We use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

Evaluate Model: We calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the model's performance.

Plot Results: We visualize the actual test data points and the regression line.

How to Run:
Copy and paste the code into a Python file (e.g., ml_project.py) and run it. The plot will show the scatter plot of actual data points and the regression line.

Feel free to experiment with different aspects of this example, such as using a different model, changing the dataset, or adding more features. This is a simple example to get you started with a live interaction project.
