House Price Prediction Project
Overview
This project uses a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on the number of rooms. The model is trained on synthetic data generated using NumPy and visualized using Matplotlib.

Technologies Used
Python
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the following libraries if you haven't already:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

How to Run the Project
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone [URL_of_your_repository]
cd House_Price_Prediction
Run the Python Script

bash
Copy code
python house_price_prediction.py
Output
When you run the script, it will:

Print the Mean Squared Error of the model, which indicates its performance.
Display a scatter plot showing the actual house prices vs. the predicted prices.
